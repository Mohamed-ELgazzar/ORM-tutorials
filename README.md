# JPA First Application

This project is a simple demonstration of creating a Java application using JPA (Java Persistence API) for database access.

## Description

The project showcases how to use JPA to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a MySQL database. It includes an `Account` entity that represents a table in the database and demonstrates basic mapping annotations and entity relationships.

## Features

- Create and configure JPA entities
- Perform database operations using JPA EntityManager
- Demonstrates annotations for mapping entities to database tables
- Use of JPA annotations for defining primary keys and generating unique identifiers
- Basic mapping of entity attributes to database columns
- Date and time handling with JPA Temporal annotations
- Basic exception handling and error logging

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- MySQL database
- JPA implementation

## Getting Started

1. Set up a MySQL database and ensure it is running.
2. Configure the database connection details in the `persistence.xml` file located in `META-INF` directory.
3. Run the `Test.java` file to perform database operations and verify the functionality.

## Usage

You can use this project as a starting point to learn and experiment with JPA. It provides a basic structure and example code for building applications that interact with databases using JPA.

Feel free to modify the code, add new features, or integrate it into your own projects.
